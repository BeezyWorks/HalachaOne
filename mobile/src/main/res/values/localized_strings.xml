    <string name="about_paragraph"><i><b>אִם לֹא בְרִיתִי יוֹמָם וָלָיְלָה חֻקּוֹת שָׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ לֹא שָׂמְתִּי\nירמיהו לג:כה\n</b></i>\nHalacha is the living covenant that binds the Jewish people to our God and fills our lives with meaning. The act of engaging with the Divine Law, both learning it and practicing it, connects us to a tradition that has lasted millennia and infuse everyday life the transcendent. While many people may wash their hands before they eat, when the Halachically observant Jew does so they touch eternity. The fact of Halacha’s complexity and breadth shows us that Holiness ought not, and indeed does not, live in designated spaces. Law gives us opportunities to seek out and encounter sanctity everywhere. By subjecting ourselves to the ordinances and statutes of the Lord of Creation, we elevate ourselves above selfishness and become creatures of purpose, obligation and responsibility. \n\nThis volume, Orach Chayim - The Way of Life, focuses on ritual law. It covers the basic practices for everyday life and holidays.</string>
